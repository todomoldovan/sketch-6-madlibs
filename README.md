Goal: My goal was to create my own "Mad Libs" by substituting words from a news article, more specifically take an article that already looks ridiculous and replace certain words with "Facebook discourse" that I have observed. I also wanted to incorporate one of my previous p5.js sketches as a background.

Accomplished: Chose an article of the dire pandemic situation in Romania and replaced adjectives and verbs with antonyms in order to include an element of misinformation. I chose to replace nouns with words people often comment under news articles to show their frustration with the current situation. People also often react to this news in funny, sarcastic ways as they do not know what else to do. This is why I chose my weaving sketch as the background, as it is fun and cheerful. 

Next steps: Incorporate images into my website and apply the same technique to change real images into memes people have created.
