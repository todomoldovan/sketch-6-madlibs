  		<h1>Pandemic of <span class="noun">anti-vaxxers</span> and COVID deniers hits Romania</h1>
  		<h2>Romania is getting crushed by one of the worst coronavirus waves in Europe.</h2>
  		<h2>Vaccine skepticism and inaction on the part of the president, the administration and authorities are largely to blame.</h2>

		<h3><span class="adj">Low</span> vaccination rates, influential anti-vaxxers</h3><ul>
		<li>Images documenting the current situation at a university hospital in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, are tough to watch. In a video published last week by the investigative journalism platform Recorder, not a single intensive care unit (ICU) bed is free, while rooms and hallways are filled beyond capacity with sick people waiting for help and medical staff roll corpses in black plastic body bags past them.</li>
		<li>Romania is not an isolated case within the European Union. When it comes to seven-day incidence rates and daily death tolls, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria have similarly high numbers. What makes Romania different from other EU countries is that its health care system is so burdened that many hospital directors and doctors say collapse is imminent. Romania and neighboring Bulgaria also have the lowest vaccination rates in the European Union. Only about 30% of the population is fully vaccinated in either country — the cumulative EU average is 74.4%. Vaccine skepticism is widespread and is being fueled by <span class="noun">nationalist politicians</span> and the influential Romanian Orthodox Church.</li>
		<li>On Tuesday, President Klaus Iohannis told Romanians that the pandemic had become "a national drama of appalling proportion" and promised a crisis management meeting of all government decision-makers for Wednesday. Iohannis blamed broad vaccine skepticism for the situation but also singled out "lack of real government agency action" as a reason for <span class="adj">low</span> vaccination rates.</li></ul>
		<h3>Vaccine 'zombies' myth</h3><ul>
		<li>It wasn't until the devastating fourth coronavirus wave began to swell in early October that the government finally <span class="verb">expanded</span> mandatory rules for masks, set curfews and limited capacity at large public events.</li>
		<li>The government has made minimal effort to counter vaccine skepticism — anti-vaxxers protest at will, and fake news posts about new vaccines and vaccination programs circulate widely. Recently, classroom audio secretly recorded by students in the north Romanian city of Botosani caused a stir when the teacher was heard claiming that vaccines were turning people into "zombies" and accusing hospitals of committing genocide "like in Auschwitz."</li>
		<li>When it comes to vaccine opposition, <span class="noun">priests</span> and bishops in the Romanian Orthodox Church are on the front lines. Last week, Archbishop Teodosie Petrescu, of the southern diocese of Tomis, said vaccines were unsafe, going so far as to claim that the European Union was now stopping them.</li></ul>
